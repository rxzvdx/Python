#How should I recycle this?
#Many people today recognize the benefits of recycling, but they do not know exactly how it should correctly be done. Your lab is to read the following 2 web pages, and based on the information, write a script that will ask the user:
#What do you want to recycle? Their choices should be the section headings of this article: https://www.epa.gov/recycle/how-do-i-recycle-common-recyclables#pla
#Then tell the user how it should be recycled
#Exception! Plastics are tricky when it comes to recycling. So if they enter plastic or Plastic, they should be asked a follow up question: What kind of plastic is it? (Foam, plastic bag, #1-7 plastic, or a #7 PLA plastic). Based on their answer, give them the right directions based on this article: https://www.ecocycle.org/plastics-recycling
