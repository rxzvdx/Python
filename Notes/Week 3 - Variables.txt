A variable is assigning a location to store a chosen value, that may be invoked to call on that value.
Ex. number = 1 this is stating, I want to store a value of 1 in memory, and when I want to call this memory location, 
I will type the word, number.
That's why we can do print(number)

firstName = 'Antonio'
lastName = 'Rosado
fullname = firstName+ ' ' +lastName

userInput = input("What is your salary?")
Assume a 26 week pay period, and 20% tax
weekly = (userInput/26)
monthly = (weekly * 4)
