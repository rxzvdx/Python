What is a Data Type?
The classification of data items. Data types represent a kind of value which determines what operations 
can be done on the data. 

Overview List of Data Types (Built in):
●Integer
●Float
●String
●List
●Dictionary
●Bool
●Tuples

Integer (int)
A whole number
Ex. 4
So we could say: A = 4
print(A) 
Returns 4

Float (float)
Numeric with multiple decimal places.
Ex. 5.0 , 5.00000000, 5.5
Stands for floating point number

String (str)
A single character (many other languages call this a char), or a collection of characters
Ex. a = ‘ok’, “ok”, or even ‘’’ok’’’
print(a) returns the ok string

List (list)
An array or sequence of ordered data, it i mutable (able to be changed or muted), and the data can be of different
types.
Ex. myList = [‘a’,’b’,’c’] or [‘a’,’ok’,14] 
Notice in the second example the first 2 spots are strings, while the 3rd is an int
This is printed using index values:
Ex. print(myList[0]) would return the string a
"A" is the 0 element
list [0;]

Dictionary (dict)
An array or sequence of data, it is immutable, and the data can be of different types. 
Ex. [‘a’,’b’,’c’] or [‘a’,’ok’,14] 
Notice in the second example the first 2 spots are strings, while the 3rd is an int

heroes= {'peter';'spiderman'}
           Key      value
print(heroes['peter'])

Tuples
An ordered collection which is immutable 
tupleFun = ("Wow", "Whoa", "ok")
print(tupleFun[number or number range ex 0 or 0:1])

Boolean (bool)
These are effectively stating whether something is True or False
Ex. a  = TRUE
This is to say when we call variable a, it will evaluate to TRUE
Ex. print(a) will return TRUE

Operators (basic ones)
Arithmetic Operators:  +,  -,  *,  /,  %,  etc.
Comparison (Relational) Operators:  ==, !=, >> , <<, >= , <=  
Assignment Operators:  = , +=, -=
Logical Operators: and, or, not
Identity Operators: is, is not
